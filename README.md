# Ubuntu-tune (obsolete)
guide to get a system tuned for responsiveness (helps with gaming, VMs, and desktop system feel)

(i can only confirm for ubuntu on this one)
# for official repository solution

Ubuntu: ``sudo apt install linux-lowlatency linux-lowlatency-headers``

# for my personal favourite which is a similar to the version of the Arch linux Zen kernel ((but for Ubuntu/Debian) Deprecated)
remove for the ubuntu part the ``-get`` on ``apt-get update`` and ``apt-get install`` it is no longer needed
